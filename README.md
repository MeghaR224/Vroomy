This is our app, Vroomy! We created it as a team as a result of the BruinAI Hackathon/AWS Summit 2025. It's an app that helps to schedule activties like showering, using the bathroom, and booking a shared room  (with roomates) so everyone can feel like their room is for them. 

Team: Megha Ravi, Oscar Berry, Neha Adapala, Gaana Jakahalli
